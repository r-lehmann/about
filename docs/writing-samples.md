# Writing samples

Here a few examples of technical writing projects that I've worked on.

:::note
Unfortunately, you won't find any work from my time on [Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/gg/). It was a incredibly fun project, and I'm very proud of a lot of the work I did there. However, the Stadia documentation was never made public, so I can't share it. Similarly, the work I did at Dematic was very impactful to the organization, but as I worked on internal documentation and training, I can't share that either. I worked on some pretty cool stuff at BlackBerry, but that's a long time ago now.

## Sample 1: Kameleoon developer docs

My most current work is on the [Kameleoon Developer Documentation](https://developers.kameleoon.com/).

**Audience**: Web and mobile app developers 

**Pages**: 
* [Homepage](https://developers.kameleoon.com/) 
* [Feature experimentation demo](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/demo-feature-experimentation)

**Summary of my contributions**: 

I'm currently working on revamping and rewriting a lot of legacy content. But those two pages are mostly completely new content that I've created from scratch.  The homepage is an example of the care I put into page design and the feature experimentation demonstrates the importance I place on getting developers to sucessfully build code as early on in their experience as possible.


## Sample 2: Immersive Stream for XR from Google Cloud

**Audience**: AR/VR developers 

**Pages**: 
* [Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/immersive-stream/xr/docs/quickstart) 
* [Overview](https://cloud.google.com/immersive-stream/xr/docs/concept)

**Summary of my contributions**: 

This project was built by the Google Cloud team in collaboration with the Stadia team. Because of the similarities in their technology stack with Stadia, I was asked to help them create their docs portal for their launch. This involved editing, writing, and setting up the new website according to the Google Cloud standards.

These docs have been updated since I last worked on them, but the [Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/immersive-stream/xr/docs/quickstart) and [Overview](https://cloud.google.com/immersive-stream/xr/docs/concept) pages are pretty close to what they looked like at launch. 

## Sample 3: This website

You can consider this whole site to be a writing sample (if a little informal). I built this site in [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static-site generator created by Meta (Facebook). I put it together in one day as if it were a new documentation project to demonstrate my technical compentency with Git, Markdown, and docs-as-code models. I'll try to keep adding to it over time.
