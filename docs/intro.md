# Intro

Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm a technical writer with more than 15 years experience writing highly technical software documentation and leading technical writing teams. 

###  A brief history of me

After high school, I had no intention of becoming a writer. None. I started out at Queen's University as a Physics major. However, I was was soon drawn into the world of coding, neural networks, and finite-state automata. Coding was fun, but it was the math and learning how computers worked that I really loved. I always liked writing, and I was pretty good at it, so I took a few writing classes along the way too.

It wasn't until I started looking at jobs near graduation that I kept seeing a role called Technical Writer, and thought, that might work. Nearly twenty years later, here I am. I've had a front row seat to the rise of smartphones with BlackBerry, a whirlwind of automated warehouses at Dematic, and streaming video games and AR/VR technology at Google among others.
